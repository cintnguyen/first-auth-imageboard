### Things I'm proud of:
- I have always been a Pinterest / Tumblr girl at heart. So to build something that paid homage to these things was a huge milestone! I am a huge believer in community. And my hope with Image Board is that it fosters community centered around images and interactions. A place we can all go to inspire and be inspired.
- This was one of the first full-stack applications I ever built! It gave me a lot of foundational experience with MongoDB, and strengthened my understanding of CRUD functionality 

### ðŸ’¡ Next steps:
- Currently the app has a centralized image board for all users to populate. The next thing I would do is create individual feeds for a more curated user experience
- The app currently allows for users to interact with the posted images by liking, disliking, starring and deleting. I would add more customization by allowing for the images starred to be populated on a users personal feed. While the most liked are repopulated to the top of the board. 
- The background image is my favorite image and is the current default. I would incorporate a new functionality where users are able to cuztomize to their preferred background.
